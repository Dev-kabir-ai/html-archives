    <h1>COLLEGE HIGHLIGHT</h1>
    <P>College is a crazy time. It's the intersection of life, money, education, career, and more. It's a time to learn,
      to figure out yourself, to be on your own, and to start to understand life.

      With that in mind, it's essential to connect with like-minded people (even if only across the internet).

      Many students who go off to college think they can use the same study methods they did in high school.
      Unfortunately, many find that college study may be much different than high school. Being successful at college
      takes much more such as drive and ambition. -NAME- focuses on helping you win at college. You won’t find tips on
      how to do your laundry XD Instead, we provide study hacks and tactics that can help reduce study time as well as
      methods to actually change the way you think. The methods provided can improve the ability to make decisions,
      learn outside of class, and achieve more during your college years and beyond. </P>

        <h3> SKILL SET</h3>
        <P>Succeeding in college doesn’t just mean taking notes and doing well on exams. Possessing certain skills will
          help you be successful in all aspects of college — inside and outside the classroom. Developing skills will
          allow you to feel more confident in using emerging technology and you will become faster in finishing tasks.

        <h3>GRADES</h3>
        <P>Grades are not the measure of a person, nor are they even the sole measure of academic accomplishment.
          However, grades can also be a factor for consideration into an honor society in college, eligiblity for
          special funding and opens the door for incredible opportunities. You can travel abroad, become a campus
          leader, and get to know faculty when you are part of a scholarly organization. </P>

      <div class="blog-tab">
        <h3>NETWORKING</h3>
        <P>Networking is even more imperative in your senior year. By developing a support system of contacts who know
          what you are looking for, you will have access to job opportunities and referrals that are specifically
          directed to you. Connect with your peers on LinkedIn and Twitter. This will maintain your network after
          graduation and allow you to learn of opportunities shared by your connections.</P>

    <h1>Dev Aspirations- WHERE TO START?</h1>
    <p>Software is essential in nearly every industry, which means you can pursue a career in a field that aligns with
      your passions and interests. Software developers use their programming skills to create new software and update
      existing applications. If you’re a creative thinker who enjoys problem solving, a career as a software developer
      could be a good fit. In this role, you may be involved with every stage of the software development process, from
      figuring out what users need and how they'll use the software to rolling out a completed application. You may
      sometimes work with computer programmers, although many developers complete all the coding themselves. </p>

    <h1>TOP 3 DOMAINS</h1>
    <p>Many software companies are trying to maintain a competitive edge with continuous product enhancements. However,
      it is not an easy task as it requires careful planning with strategic steps over time. Having a clear overview of
      the future digital product ultimately helps track the progress of the project milestones and manage expectations
      during the project’s lifecycle. It keeps all the stakeholders aligned with the company’s business priorities and
      strategic goals.</p>

        <h3>1. Android Development</h3>
        <p>Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android
          operating system. Google states that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using
          the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible.</p>

        <h3>2. Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business
          operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies,
          such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning
          has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.</p>

        <h3>3. OpenSource</h3>
        <p>Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any
          skill you can imagine. Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for
          years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running
          into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.</p>
